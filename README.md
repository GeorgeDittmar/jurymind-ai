**Collective AI Judgment for Smarter Models**

---

## Overview

JuryMind AI is designed to harness the power of large language models (LLMs) as intelligent judges. Our platform enables automated LLM evaluation, prompt optimization, dataset generation and auto-labeling with agentic AI judges working collaboratively â€” like a jury of experts.

JuryMind AI empowers ML teams, AI researchers, and startups to measure, refine, and improve their language models and prompt engineering workflows with minimal manual effort.

## Features

- **LLM Evaluation:** Score model outputs based on customizable criteria using expert LLM judges.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Iteratively improve prompts to achieve specified goals like clarity, relevance, or conciseness.
- **Dataset Generation** Generate high-quality datasets over your data.
- **Auto Labeling:** Generate high-quality labels automatically using AI-driven judgments.
- **Agentic Judges:** Leverage multiple AI agents working in parallel or consensus for robust evaluations.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend the platform with modules like JudgeLab(TBD), PromptLab(TBD), and LabelLab(TBD).
